# Archive to S3

This repository contains a script to archive files and upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket using multipart upload. The script splits large files into smaller parts and uploads them in parallel to optimize the upload process.

## Usage

To use the script, run the following command:

```sh
./archive-to-s3.sh <bucket-name> [source-path]
```

## Parameters

- bucket-name: (Required) The name of your S3 bucket
- source-path: (Optional) Path to the directory to archive. Defaults to current working directory if omitted

## Examples

```
# Archive from specific path
./archive-to-s3.sh my-bucket /path/to/archive

# Archive from current directory
./archive-to-s3.sh my-bucket
```
